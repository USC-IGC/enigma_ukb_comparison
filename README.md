# ENIGMA UKB Comparison

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook with analysis comparing ENIGMA and UK Biobank diffusion processing pipelines.

If the Full Results Table of Contents internal links do not work, the diffusion comparison notebook can also be viewed on http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/USC-IGC/enigma_ukb_comparison/blob/master/diffusion_comparison.ipynb

An HTML is also included though it is too large for GitHub to render at this time. If you would like to see it, please clone or download the repository.
